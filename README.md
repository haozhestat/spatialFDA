This repository contains the R code and dataset to reproduce the simulation studies and data analysis in the paper "Spatially Dependent Functional Data: Covariance Estimation, Principal Component Analysis, and Prediction" written by [Haozhe Zhang](https://haozhestat.github.io) and Prof. [Yehua Li](https://sites.google.com/a/ucr.edu/yehuali).

An R package "spatialFDA" is under development, expected to release by the early of 2019. This package will estimate the 3-dim spatio-temporal covariance function for a given dataset, the leading functional principal components, the spatial covariance/correlation functions, and the covariance function of functional nugget effect as well. A functional Kriging function will also be embedded in this package.
